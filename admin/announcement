We are pleased to announce the updated release of CxxTest 4.2.  CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. CxxTest is easy to use because it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible form of test discovery.

This release resolves the following issues:

 - Changes to support test fixtures in namespaces
 - Adding logic to support test skipping
 - Change to create self-contained HTML documentation
 - Fixed inheritance issue in GlobalFixture (#69)
 - Update LGPL version
 - Changes to try/catch to avoid ambiguities withn catching std::exception (#53)
 - Fixed TS_ASSERT_DELTA to work on integer types (#65)
 - Changed output format to print world-name (#70)

See the CxxTest Home Page (http://cxxtest.com) for documentation and download instructions.

Enjoy!
